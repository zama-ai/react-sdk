# useEthersSigner (Deprecated)

> **Deprecated:** This hook is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. The SDK now uses EIP-1193 providers directly, eliminating the need for ethers.js signers.

## Deprecation Notice

This hook is no longer needed. The SDK now uses EIP-1193 providers directly via `FhevmProvider`, eliminating the need for ethers.js signers. All signing operations are handled internally.
